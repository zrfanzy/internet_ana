\section{Faces}
\subsection{Dimensionality of the Dataset}
1. There are \emph{5000} faces and \emph{50} measurements.\\
2.  See the \emph{variance-dimension} plot as below:\\
\centerline{
\includegraphics[width=13cm]{pic/p1}}\\
3. I perfer to describe the face with \emph{7} variable parts: \emph{hat color, hair length, hair color, eye size, face color, mouth shape, eye color}. \\
4. I sorted the variances and get the plot: \\
\centerline{
\includegraphics[width=13cm]{pic/p2}}\\
5.  \\
\subsection{Principal Component Analysis}
See file \emph{CoActorPrediction.java} to view my implementation of the classes.
\\
And I computer \emph{MyOwnScorning} with:
\\
\centerline{$\frac{N(u, v)^{2} \times \sqrt{|N(u)-N(v)|}}{N(u) + N(v)}$}
\\
In which N(i) stands for neibour number of i, and N(i, j) stands for common neibour number of i and j.
\\
And Here's accuracy of the 3 link prediction strategies: 

\begin{table}[!hbp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
Name & Accuracy & Improvement \\
\hline
PreferentialAttachment & 2.096\% & 3.19x \\
\hline
CommonNeighbors & 5.114\% & 7.79x \\
\hline
MyOwnScoring & 5.388\% & 8.21x \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Random Walks}
1. Setting N = 10000 and node u as initial seed, the average of a Facebook user is \emph{48.6725}, which still has a difference with the reference answer. The problem I think, is the \emph{algorithm itself}, and \emph{maybe node u is in a small component of the network}, and maybe \emph{the dataset itself changes}.
\\
2. I changed walk strategy in my algorithm: every time I walk across 3 people instead of one(i.e. I walk to the node's neighbor's neighbor's neighbor instead of its neighbor), and there's also a repeat judgment in my code. After changing, the estimated age becomes \emph{50.675}, which is more close to the reference answer.
\\
\subsection{Bizarre Social Networks}
1. Setting N = 10000 and using different beginning node, we get average age as below: \\

\begin{table}[!hbp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
Beginning Node & Average Age & Age of Beginning Node \\
\hline
u & 50.1445 & 13\\
\hline
v & 55.5635 & 39 \\
\hline
w & 64.1295 & 89 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

we can see much difference between each other. And we can also find that with younger beginning node we get smaller average age and with older beginning node we get larger average age. Maybe it's the \emph{Herding} property. The friends are seems so familiar.\\
\\
2. The same strategy as above, now get the answers:\\

\begin{table}[!hbp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
Beginning Node & Average Age & Age of Beginning Node \\
\hline
u & 58.721 & 13\\
\hline
v & 58.2856 & 39 \\
\hline
w & 57.4979 & 89 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The answeres now become more similar :) \\


Finally, I use my strategy(this time, walk across 6 people every time) on the \emph{Directions}, get answers:\\

\begin{table}[!hbp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
Beginning Node & Average Age & Age of Beginning Node \\
\hline
u & 49.5636 & 23\\
\hline
v & 49.4373 & 22 \\
\hline
w & 49.4054 & 39 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

So, my estimate of the average age of Directions's users is \emph{49.5}.
