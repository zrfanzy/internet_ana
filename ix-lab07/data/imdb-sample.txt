006237	Alexandra DeMonaco was a good citizen and a devoted mom... until the day
006237	she was arrested. How could she know her no-good husband was running a

008029	When Homicide Detective Kang Oh Soo hit a dead end in his investigation of
008029	two seemly unrelated murders, except for the Tarot cards left behind at
008029	both crime scenes, he sought help from Seo Hae In, a woman with

008029	determination to catch the Tarot Card mastermind. Oh Soo was reminded that
008029	years ago he had killed a high school classmate in a fight. He was
008029	acquitted of all charges and began his life anew. Now, someone has came

017763	unexpected pregnancy. Carmine and Sasha live in a comfortable world where

017763	father. Their violent relationship makes getting an abortion the obvious
017763	choice. Yet somehow things never seem to work out as they should... Stephen

179852	Til Death Do Us Part takes the viewer on a journey with incarcerated
179852	battered women, as they relate their stories from first falling in love,
179852	through the abuse by their spouses, the murder, trial, parole process, and
179852	finally, for one woman, freedom. There is a stigma in our society that a
179852	woman can leave an abusive relationship at any time. However, the women in
179852	this film prove the contrary. They were under the age of 24, isolated from
179852	their families and had virtually no money. They all reached a point where
179852	there was a final beating in which that survival instinct prevailed. In
179852	these final moments, they snapped and killed. The justice system was not
179852	set up for women who acted in defense of their lives. Before the O.J.
179852	Simpson, trial, there was little accepted evidence, no taped 911 calls, no
179852	police reports on domestic violence and therefore, no acceptable proof.
179852	Self defense was based on a male model for two men of equal physical build.
179852	Self defense was not applicable if a woman armed herself with a kitchen
179852	knife or her husband's handgun. These women go through a grueling parole
179852	process where they are often approved for parole, only to have the verdict
179852	reversed by the Governor. There is a non-profit legal group, The Habeas
179852	Project, fighting to retry as many women who qualify under Habeas Corpus as
179852	possible. They have a deadline. Four hundred incarcerated women must find
179852	affordable legal counsel and go to trial before the year 2010. No one has
179852	heard their stories until now.
179852	'Til Death' follows stories of battered women who killed their husbands
179852	and/or boyfriends in the defense of their life or the life of their
179852	children. All women were sentenced to life terms in prison for their crime.
179852	The film follows their plight for freedom within an archaic justice system.
190780	Sammy, an average teenager, apparently has one flaw: an "attitude" about
190780	driving. He mocks those who drive safely, and speeds all over town,
190780	encouraged by his girlfriend, who finds his recklessness "manly" and
190780	"courageous." Sammy finally bites the bullet, and is killed in a car
190780	crash--caused not only by his speeding, says a police officer, but by his
190780	"immature defiance of authority" and "unhealthy thrill seeking."
