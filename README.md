2014.2.17 - 2014.

labs for INTERNET ANALYTICS (http://icawww1.epfl.ch/ix)

Lab01: Hadoop Tutorial
-------------
Simple hadoop works like word-counting and twitter text process.<br />

Lab02: Network Structure
-------------
Look at degree distribution (datas are wiki-links): plot like power distribution.<br />
Deel with edge removal (to scale down the Giant Component): random & targeted (local bridge).<br />

Lab03: Network Prediction and Sampling
-------------
Prediect co-author (datas are movie co-author network).<br />
Random walks to count average of social media network on different networks:<br />
  Facebook: nodes with more neighbour counts more.<br />
  Ages: different component with different average age.<br />
  Directions: walk into a cannot-go-back component.<br />

Lab04: Dimensionality Reduction
-------------
Measurements of computer-generated faces. (Using PCA)<br />
Same analysis with Smartvote. (political)<br />

Lab05: Recommender Systems
-------------
Make recommender system on data from THE NETFLIX PRIZE<br />
  Method 1: Similarity-based recommender.<br />
  Method 2: UV-factorization (paper on http://goo.gl/YrUxB).<br />
  Using RMSE to evalute.

Lab06: Clustering and Community Detection
-------------
